# simple-ATM
The ATM system has already been completed(without GUI).
It has five functions including balance checking, withdrawing, depositing, detailed account checking and transferring.
Before using the programme, you should add at least 2 accounts to enable the transferring function because the Programme could only manipulate the local information and transfer between them.
Password should have no more than six figures.
Don't enter your full name, and do not include spaces in your name.
Thank you for using the programme. Instructive suggestions are always welcome.

Author is a freshman and just started to learning C and Java.
